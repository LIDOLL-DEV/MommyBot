# Contributing to MommyBot

The application is an ES-module Node.js Discord bot. Runtime code lives under
`src/`; dependency versions are declared in `package.json` and resolved in
`package-lock.json`. Keep both in sync and use `npm ci` to reproduce installs.
Run `npm test` before deploying.

Fedora deployment files live under `scripts/`. Keep Bash and systemd files in LF
format; `.gitattributes` enforces this on checkout. See
[DEPLOYMENT_FEDORA.md](DEPLOYMENT_FEDORA.md) for installation and recovery and
[TESTING_GUIDE.md](TESTING_GUIDE.md) for verification.

Preserve the deployment boundary: code belongs in immutable release directories,
configuration in `/etc/mommybot`, and writable data in `/var/lib/mommybot`. New
persistent files should live under `data/` so stopped-state backups include them.
Document new environment variables in `.env.example`. Never commit credentials,
SQLite files, node_modules or private chat history.

If startup's Discord-ready message changes, update the deployment readiness
check. If shutdown handling changes, keep `KillSignal` in the systemd unit in
sync. Any database migration needs a documented rollback strategy because code
rollback alone does not restore older data.
